        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Is my data private and secure?</h3>
        <p>Yes. All SOAP notes are stored locally on your device. We do not transmit your data to our servers or any third parties. If you enable iCloud, your data syncs securely through your personal Apple iCloud account. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>

        <h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
        <p>Yes! WFR TrailTriage is fully functional without an internet connection, making it perfect for backcountry and remote wilderness settings.</p>

        <h3>How do I export my SOAP notes?</h3>
        <p>You can export individual SOAP notes as formatted text from within the note detail view. This allows you to share documentation with medical professionals or emergency services when needed.</p>

        <h3>Can I sync my notes across devices?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you enable iCloud sync in your device settings, your SOAP notes will automatically sync across all your Apple devices signed in with the same Apple ID.</p>

        <h3>Is WFR TrailTriage HIPAA compliant?</h3>
        <p>WFR TrailTriage is designed with healthcare privacy in mind, but HIPAA compliance depends on how you use the app. We recommend using device passcodes, being careful when sharing data, and following your organization's policies. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>What iOS version do I need?</h3>
        <p>WFR TrailTriage requires iOS 17.0 or later for iPhone, and iPadOS 17.0 or later for iPad.</p>

        <h3>Can I attach photos to SOAP notes?</h3>
        <p>Photo and voice note attachments are supported in the app's data model and may be available in future updates.</p>

        <h3>How do I delete a SOAP note?</h3>
        <p>Swipe left on a note in the notes list to reveal delete options, or use the delete button within the note detail view.</p>

        <h3>What happens if I uninstall the app?</h3>
        <p>If you uninstall WFR TrailTriage, all locally stored data will be deleted. If you have iCloud sync enabled, your data remains in iCloud and will be restored when you reinstall the app and sign in with the same Apple ID.</p>
