                <div class="about-section">
                    <h3>The App</h3>
                    <p>TrailTriage is a professional documentation and reference tool designed by wilderness first responders, for wilderness first responders. Built to support real-world field medicine, this app combines established wilderness medicine protocols with practical tools refined through hands-on experience in remote environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether you're guiding an expedition, working at a backcountry camp, or responding to an incident on the trail, TrailTriage provides the structure and tools you need to document patient encounters professionally and completely—even when you're miles from cell service.</p>

                <div class="about-section">
                    <h3>The Developer</h3>
                    <p><strong>Luke Alvarez</strong> created TrailTriage from firsthand experience in wilderness medicine and a passion for building tools that solve real problems in the field.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a developer and wilderness first responder, Luke saw the gap between what WFR training teaches and what tools were actually available during real incidents in remote environments. Wet paper forms, inadequate checklists, and missing critical details during high-stress situations motivated the creation of TrailTriage.</p>
                    
                    <p>The result is an app that doesn't just digitize a form—it guides responders through comprehensive patient assessment, maintains alignment with NOLS and WFR protocols, and ensures nothing gets missed during the chaos of an emergency.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>"I built TrailTriage to be the tool I wish I'd had during my own wilderness medicine responses—something that works offline, follows the protocols I learned, and actually helps me provide better patient care when it matters most."</em></p>
